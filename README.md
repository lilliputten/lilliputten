# Hi, I'm Igor a.k.a. Lilliputten

I'm a professional front-end (and full-stack) web developer. Having about 8 years of experience in web frontend development, I mainly specialize in JavaScript (with React.js for frontend), Python and related technologies.

At the moment I work for my clients in different countries (see Â«[Projects](https://lilliputten.com/projects)Â» section on my site), and still considering interesting offers.
